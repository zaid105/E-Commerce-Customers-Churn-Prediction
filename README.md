# Customers Churn Prediction
Customer churn or attrition is one of the most crucial problems for any business that directly sells or serves customers Be it Telecom service providers, eCommerce or SaaS businesses it is important to track and analyse how many customers are leaving the platform and how many are sticking and the reasons behind them. Knowing customer behaviour can greatly enhance decision-making processes and can further help reduce churn to improve profitability.

In this article, we are going to analyse an eCommerce dataset and find the best model to predict customer churn. But before delving into analysis letâ€™s have a brief look at what is churn.

# What is Churn Analysis?
Customer churn can be defined as the rate at which customers leave a platform or service. And customer churn analysis is the method of analysing the rate. There are usually two kinds of churn.
<br><br>
Voluntary Churn:  when the customer voluntarily chooses to not subscribe anymore, for example, they got a better deal somewhere else or they had a dissatisfactory experience.
<br><br>
Involuntary Churn: when the customer involuntarily leaves the platform, for example, payment failures because credit card maxed out.
<br><br>
Some of the churns are expected but when the churn is high it could highly impact the bottom line of the company. It also reveals the net consumer perception of the company, which is essentially an important factor in the long term growth and sustainability of the company. It is pretty much intuitive to know if there is a significant churn or not but unless and until we have key data points to draw actionable insight it is just a guessing game. Several factors influence churn and understanding each can give us a pretty solid idea of what to do next.
